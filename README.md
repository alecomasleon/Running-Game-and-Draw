# Running-Game-and-Draw
Draw a character using Draw.java, then play the classic "no-wifi" dinosaur game with that drawing.

First, run Draw.java to create a custom drawing. Press the "Save" button to save that drawing.

Run RunningGame to play the dino-running game. Press the file with the drawing you made to bring your custom character into the game.

I used JFrame for all the UI elements.
